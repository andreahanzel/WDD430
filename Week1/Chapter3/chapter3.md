# CHAPTER 3: Updating UI with JavaScript

In this chapter, I learned how to manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) using JavaScript. By selecting elements, creating new elements, and appending them dynamically, I was able to update the UI without modifying the original HTML structure.

## Key Takeaways

- The DOM represents the structure of a web page as a tree of nodes.
- JavaScript can be used to select, create, and modify elements dynamically.
- Using document.createElement() and appendChild(), I successfully added an H1 element to the page.
- This method is imperative, meaning I manually wrote steps to update the UI.
