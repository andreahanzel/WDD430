# CHAPTER 4: Getting Started with React

In this chapter, I learned how to set up React in a basic HTML file by loading React and ReactDOM from CDN links. I also explored JSX, a syntax that looks like HTML but works inside JavaScript. Since browsers donâ€™t understand JSX directly, I added Babel to compile it into regular JavaScript.

Instead of using plain JavaScript to update the DOM, I used ReactDOM.createRoot() to render an `<h1>` element inside a `<div>` with the ID `#app`. This was my first step in learning how React helps make UI development easier and more efficient.

Key Takeaways:

- Added React and ReactDOM using CDN links.
- Learned about JSX and why it needs to be compiled.
- Used Babel to transform JSX into JavaScript.
- Rendered an element using ReactDOM.createRoot() instead of manually updating the DOM.
