# CHAPTER 5: Building UI with Components  

In this chapter, I learned how to create React components and render them dynamically using JSX.  
Instead of manipulating the DOM manually, I used React components, which are reusable building blocks of a React app.  

## Key Takeaways

- Created React components (`Header`, `HomePage`).  
- Used JSX to structure the UI inside JavaScript.  
- Nested components inside each other.  
- Rendered components using ReactDOM.createRoot() instead of manually updating the DOM.
