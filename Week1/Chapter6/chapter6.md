# CHAPTER 6: Displaying Data with Props  

In this chapter, I learned how to pass data dynamically between React components using props.  
Props allow us to reuse components while displaying different information based on the data passed to them.  

## Key Takeaways

- Created a Header component** that accepts a `title` prop.  
- Used curly braces `{}`** to access props inside JSX.  
- Improved reusability** by avoiding duplicate code.
