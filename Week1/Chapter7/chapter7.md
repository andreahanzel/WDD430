# CHAPTER 7: Adding Interactivity with State  

In this chapter, I learned how to add interactivity to React components using state and event handlers.  

## Key Takeaways

- State allows React components to store and update dynamic data.  
- The `useState` hook is used to define and manage state variables.  
- State updates trigger automatic re-renders in React.  
- Event handlers (e.g., onClick)** allow users to interact with the UI.  
- Instead of modifying the DOM manually, React updates the UI - efficiently-  when the state changes.
