# Chapter 8: From React to Next.js

In this chapter, I practiced moving a React project into a Next.js environment.

## Key Steps

1. Created a basic **React app** in an `index.html` file.
2. Verified that the app renders correctly.
3. Set up a **Next.js project** using `npx create-next-app@latest`.
4. Migrated my React code into `pages/index.js` inside the Next.js project.
5. Successfully ran the Next.js version of the app on `localhost:3000`.

### Key Learnings

- Next.js provides a structured way to build React apps.
- It includes server-side rendering (SSR)and file-based routing.
- Migrating from React to Next.js is simple by copying React components into `pages/`.
