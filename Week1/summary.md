# Week 1: React Foundations - SUMMARY

1. **What is the DOM?**
The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a webpage as a tree of nodes where each element is a node. JavaScript can interact with the DOM to dynamically update content, styles, and structure without reloading the page.

2. **What is the difference between Imperative vs Declarative Programming?**

- **Imperative Programming:** Writing step-by-step instructions on how to achieve a task (e.g., using JavaScript to manually create and append an `<h1>` element). E.g.: Writing a recipe with step-by-step instructions to make a pizza.

- **Declarative Programming:** Describing what should be done and letting the system determine how to do it (e.g., React's JSX, where you declare UI components instead of manually updating the DOM). E.g.: imply ordering a pizza and letting the chef handle the process.

3.**What is JSX?**
JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write UI elements in a format similar to HTML inside JavaScript. JSX makes React code more readable and expressive.

4.**What is the Babel interpreter?**
Babel is a JavaScript compiler that transforms modern JavaScript and JSX into browser-compatible JavaScript. Since browsers do not understand JSX natively, Babel converts JSX into standard JavaScript so it can be executed.
